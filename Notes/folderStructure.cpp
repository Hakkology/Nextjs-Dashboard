/*

/app: Routes, components, and logic for your application

/app/lib: Functions used in your application, reusable utility and data fetching functions.

/app/ui: UI Components.

/public: Static assets, yaml files.

/scripts: Just a seeding script to be able to work on.

Config Files: next.config.js at the root of application.

Separate UIs for each route using layout.tsx and page.tsx files.

page.tsx is a special Next.js file that exports a React component, and it's required for the route to be accessible. 
In your application, you already have a page file: /app/page.tsx - this is the home page associated with the route 
To create a nested route, you can nest folders inside each other and add page.tsx files inside them.
